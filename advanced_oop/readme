1. Create a structure (in C++ programming language) Film for representing films (movies). The structure should contain:

   Movie title (array of 100 characters)
   Duration (integer)
   Price (decimal number)
   Is there a student discount (1-yes, 0-no)
   Create a structure FilmFestival, that will contain:

   Name of the festival (array of 100 characters)
   Place (where the festival is held) (array of 100 characters)
   List of films that will be presented on the festival (array of no more than 100 elements of type Film)
   Number of elements in the list (integer)
   Write a function print that will print the information for each film in a given film festival in the following format:

   [Name of the festival] [Place]
   [Title1] [Duration1] [Price1]
   [Title2] [Duration2] [Price2]
   ...
   Write a function BestFestival that accepts an array of FilmFestival variables and number of festivals in the array and
   will print the name of the festival that is cheapest for students and the place it is held. For the cheapest festival
   is considered the one that has most films that have student discount. If there is more that one festival with these
   characteristics than print the festival that has the longest duration of all the films.
   Complete functionality of the whole program <br>

   2. Define a structure for Driver with fields for his name (char array of max 100) and time in seconds (integer). (5 points) Then define a structure Race with fields for location (char array of max 100), number of drivers (integers) and an array of drivers (max 100). (5 points)

      Write a main function that will read the data for N races and for each race will print the top 3 drivers by their time in increasing order. (30 points)

      For the format of the input data and format of the output, see the sample input and sample output (the time is printed in two fixed places for minutes and two fixed places with leading zero for seconds, separated with :).
