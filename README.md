# OOP

<p>These are some Object-oriented exercises/tasks that I did, some of them may be unfinished and need to be worked on, but mostly they are just exercises that I did to understand OOP. If you happen to know any better solution for any of the tasks, feel free to contact me via email (fejmiqaz@gmail.com).</p>
